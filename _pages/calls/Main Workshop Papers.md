## Important Notice
**commission link** is now TBD.

## Overview
The 21th Annual Workshop of the Australasian Language Technology Association will be held in a hybrid format at University of Melbourne, Melbourne, from the TBD to the TBD of December 2023

The hybrid format gives participants a valuable opportunity to socialise either in-person or online venue.

The ALTA 2023 workshop is the key local forum for socialising research results in natural language processing and computational linguistics, with presentations and posters from students, industry, and academic researchers. Like previous years, we would also like to encourage submissions and participation from industry and government researchers and developers.

Note that ALTA is listed in recently updated CORE 2022 Conference Rankings as Australasian B. See details from CORE Rankings Portal.

- phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse
- speech recognition, understanding and generation
- interpreting spoken and written language
- natural language generation
- linguistic, mathematical, and psychological models of language
- NLP-based information extraction and retrieval
- corpus-based and statistical language modelling
- machine translation and translation aids
- question answering and information extraction
- natural language interfaces and dialogue systems
- natural language and multimodal systems
- message and narrative understanding systems
- evaluations of language systems
- embodied conversational agents
- computational lexicography
- summarization
- language resources
- topic modelling, semantics and ontology
- unsupervised language learning and analysis
- social media analysis and processing
- search and information retrieval
- domain-specific adaptation of natural language processing algorithms
- applied natural language processing and/or applications in industry
- We particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community through the consideration of
- practical applications of language technology and through multi-disciplinary research. We also specifically
- encourage submissions from industry.

## Format
We invite submissions of two different formats: (1) Original Research Papers and (2) Abstract-based Presentations.

(1) Original Research Papers
We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of natural language processing.

Long papers should be 6-8 pages and short papers should be 3-4 pages. Accepted papers will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. We only accpect poster presentation for participants who are presenting on site. Both short and long papers may include unlimited pages of references in addition to the page count requirements.

Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly submitted papers should not include the identity of author(s) and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g. using third person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your person website, etc. Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.

(2) Abstract-based Presentations
To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results, we invite 1-2 page presentation abstracts. The organisers may offer the opportunity to give an oral presentation or a poster presentation. We only accpect poster presentation for participants who are presenting on site. Submissions should include presentation title and abstract, name of the presenter, any publications relating to the work, and any information on collaboration with the local ALTA community. Abstracts will not be published in the proceedings, but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner interesting research, not limited to, but including:

established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues;
completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work;
early candidature research students presenting their work-in-progress and ideas, which may not have been published; and
industry presenting research and development over linguistic data in the context of their business.
Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated.

## Multiple Submission Policy
Original research papers that are under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We require that you declare at submission that your paper is submitted to another venue, and identify the venue. Should your paper be accepted to both ALTA and another venue, we allow you to decide whether the paper should be published in the ALTA proceedings, or if it should be treated as a Presentation (without archival publication). In this case you would still be able to present a research talk at the ALTA workshop. This is to encourage more internationally leading research to be presented at the workshop.

## Instructions for Authors
Paper Submission
Authors should submit their papers via TBD.

There are 3 tracks in TBD this year:

ALTA 2023 (Long) – use this for long papers
ALTA 2023 (Short) – use this for short papers
ALTA 2023 (Abstracts) – use this for abstracts

## Formatting Guidelines
Submissions must follow the two-column ACL format. We therefore strongly recommend you use LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word template.

## Paper Length
Long papers should be 6-8 pages
Short papers should be 3-4 pages
Abstracts ideally should be a few paragraphs and no more than 2 pages

## Anonymisation
Short and long papers must be anonymised.
Abstracts are NOT to be anonymised and must include the author's/authors' affiliation
