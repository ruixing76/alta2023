## Overview
The 21st Annual Workshop of the Australasian Language Technology Association will be held at Melbourne Connect, Melbourne, from the 29th November to 1st December 2023.

The ALTA 2023 workshop is the key local forum for socialising research results in natural language processing and computational linguistics, with presentations, posters and demonstrations from students, industry, and academic researchers. Like previous years, we would also like to encourage submissions and participation from industry and government researchers and developers.

Note that ALTA is listed in the CORE 2021 Conference Rankings as Australasian B. See details from [CORE Rankings Portal](https://www.core.edu.au/conference-portal)<base target="_blank">.


## Topics

ALTA invites the submission of papers and presentations on all aspects of natural language processing, including, but not limited to:

- Commonsense Reasoning
- Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics
-	Dialogue and Interactive Systems
-	Discourse and Pragmatics
-	Efficient Methods for NLP
-	Ethics in NLP
-	Information Extraction
-	Information Retrieval and Text Mining
-	Interpretability, Interactivity and Analysis of Models for NLP
-	Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond
-	Language Modeling and Analysis of Language Models
-	Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics
-	Machine Learning for NLP
-	Machine Translation
-	Multilinguality and Linguistic Diversity
-	Natural Language Generation
-	NLP Applications
-	Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation
-	Question Answering

We particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community through the consideration of practical applications of language technology and through multi-disciplinary research. We also specifically encourage submissions from industry.

## Format

We invite submissions of three different formats: (1) Original Research Papers; (2) Abstract-based Presentations; and (3) Industry Demonstrations.

### (1)	Original Research Papers
We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of natural language processing.

Long papers should be 7-8 pages and short papers should be 3-4 pages. Accepted papers will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on site. Both short and long papers may include unlimited pages of references in addition to the page count requirements.

Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly submitted papers should not include the identity of author(s) and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g. using third person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your personal website, etc. Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.

### (2)	Abstract-based Presentations
 
To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results, we invite 1-2 page presentation abstracts. The organisers may offer the opportunity to give an oral presentation or a poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on site. Submissions should include presentation title and abstract, name of the presenter, any publications relating to the work, and any information on collaboration with the local ALTA community. Abstracts will not be published in the proceedings, but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner interesting research, not limited to, but including:

-	established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues;
-	completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work;
-	early candidature research students presenting their work-in-progress and ideas, which may not have been published.

Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated.

### (3)	Industry Demonstrations

To encourage industry participation and networking opportunities, we are thrilled to announce a track for industry demonstrations, which provides an exciting opportunity for industry researchers to showcase their NLP applications. You should submit a proposal that is 1-2 pages long, containing: (1) a description of the software, tools or applications that will be presented and how NLP techniques are used to address a specific problem; and (2) a brief introduction of your organisation. The proposals will be reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to select demonstrations that best align with the interest of the ALTA community.

## Multiple Submission Policy

Original research papers that are under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We require that you declare at submission that your paper is submitted to another venue, and identify the venue. Should your paper be accepted to both ALTA and another venue, we allow you to decide whether the paper should be published in the ALTA proceedings, or if it should be treated as a Presentation (without archival publication). In this case you would still be able to present a research talk at the ALTA workshop. This is to encourage more internationally leading research to be presented at the workshop.

## Instructions for Authors Paper Submission
 
Authors should submit their papers via OpenReview: <https://openreview.net/group?id=ALTA.asn.au/2023/Workshop><base target="_blank"> (using the “ALTA 2023 Workshop Submission” button)

Short papers should be 3-4 pages (excluding references) \
Abstracts ideally should be a few paragraphs and no more than 2 pages Industry demonstration proposals should be 1-2 pages

### Anonymisation
