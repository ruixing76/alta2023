## Melbourne
Melbourne is the coastal capital of the southeastern Australian state of Victoria. Melbourne is home of many of Australia's best-known landmarks, such as the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the National Gallery of Victoria and the World Heritage-listed Royal Exhibition Building. Noted for its cultural heritage, the city gave rise to Australian rules football, Australian impressionism and Australian cinema, and has more recently been recognized as a UNESCO City of Literature and a global centre for street art, live music and theatre. Melbourne has now attracted the largest proportion of international overseas immigrants.
