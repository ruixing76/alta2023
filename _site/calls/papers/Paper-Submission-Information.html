        <h2 id="long-papers">Long Papers</h2>

<p>Long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Review forms will be made available prior to the deadlines. Long papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references and appendix; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.</p>

<h2 id="short-papers">Short Papers</h2>

<p>Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages.</p>

<p>Short papers may consist of up to 4 pages of content, plus unlimited references and appendix. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given 5 content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers’ comments in their final versions.</p>

<h2 id="presentation-mode">Presentation Mode</h2>

<p>Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and as posters.</p>

<h2 id="authorship">Authorship</h2>

<p>The author list for submissions should include all (and only) individuals who made substantial contributions to the work presented. Each author listed on a submission to EMNLP 2022 will be notified of submissions, revisions and the final decision. No changes to the order or composition of authorship may be made to submissions to EMNLP 2022 after the abstract submission deadline.</p>

<h2 id="citation-and-comparison">Citation and Comparison</h2>

<p>You are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to your submission, but you may be excused for not knowing about all unpublished work (especially work that has been recently posted and/or is not widely cited). While not citing such unpublished works upon submission is not sufficient grounds for paper rejection, you are expected to cite such relevant work in camera ready, if notified about it by reviewers.</p>

<p>In cases where a preprint has been superseded by a refereed publication, the refereed publication should be cited instead of the preprint version. Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than 3 months before the submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to your submission, and you are therefore not obliged to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis. However, you are expected to mention such works in your submission, and list their published results if they are directly relevant.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation">ACL Policies for Submission, Review, and Citation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-submission-policy">Multiple Submission Policy</h2>

<p>EMNLP 2022 will not consider any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the EMNLP 2022 review period. This policy covers all refereed and archival conferences and workshops (e.g., NeurIPS, ACL workshops), as well as ARR. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Authors submitting more than one paper to EMNLP 2022 must ensure that their submissions do not overlap significantly (&gt;25%) with each other in content or results.</p>

<p>EMNLP 2022 will also accept submissions of ARR-reviewed papers, provided that the ARR reviews and meta-reviews are available by the ARR-to-conference submission deadline. However, EMNLP 2022 will not accept direct submissions that are actively under review in ARR, or that overlap significantly (&gt;25%) with such submissions.</p>

<h2 id="mandatory-discussion-of-limitations">Mandatory Discussion of Limitations</h2>

<p>We believe that it is also important to discuss the limitations of your work, in addition to its strengths. <strong>EMNLP 2022 requires all papers to have a clear discussion of limitations, in a dedicated section titled “Limitations”.</strong> This section will appear at the end of the paper, after the discussion/conclusions section and before the references, and will not count towards the page limit. <strong>Papers without a limitation section will be automatically rejected without review.</strong></p>

<p>ARR-reviewed paper that did not include “<strong>Limitations</strong>” section in their prior submission, should submit a PDF with such a section together with their EMNLP 2022 submission.</p>

<p>While we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative. In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire crucial further investigation are welcome.</p>

<h2 id="emnlp-2022-theme-track-open-questions-major-obstacles-and-unresolved-issues-in-nlp">EMNLP 2022 Theme Track: “Open questions, major obstacles, and unresolved issues in NLP”</h2>

<p>Following the success of previous major NLP conferences Theme tracks, we are happy to announce that EMNLP 2022 will have a new theme with the goal of reflecting and stimulating discussion about the state of the field, with a forward looking focus of exposing what is yet to be done, and how to get there:  “Open questions, major obstacles, and unresolved issues in NLP.”  While we believe this theme naturally invites position papers, we especially encourage thought-provoking contributions that support their arguments with empirical evidence, in the tradition of EMNLP.</p>

<h2 id="ethics-policy">Ethics Policy</h2>

<p>Authors are required to honor the ethical code set out in the ACL <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics">Code of Ethics</a>. The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent. We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code. Where a paper may raise ethical issues, we ask that you include in the paper an explicit discussion of these issues, which will be taken into account in the review process. We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work.</p>

<p>Authors will be allowed extra space after the 8th page (4th for short papers) for an optional broader impact statement or other discussion of ethics. The EMNLP review form will include a section addressing these issues and papers flagged for ethical concerns by reviewers or ACs will be further reviewed by an ethics committee. Note that an ethical considerations section is not required, but papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks that do not discuss these issues will not be accepted. Conversely, the mere inclusion of an ethical considerations section does not guarantee acceptance. In addition to acceptance or rejection, papers may receive a conditional acceptance recommendation. Camera-ready versions of papers designated as conditional accept will be re-reviewed by the ethics committee to determine whether the concerns have been adequately addressed. Please read the <a href="https://2021.emnlp.org/call-for-papers/ethics-faq">ethics FAQ</a> for more guidance on some problems to look out for and key concerns to consider relative to the code of ethics.</p>

<h2 id="paper-submission-and-templates">Paper Submission and Templates</h2>
<p>Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system. Both long and short papers must follow the EMNLP 2022 two-column format, using the supplied official style files. <strong>Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.</strong></p>

<h3 id="verification">Verification</h3>

<p>To guarantee conformance to publication standards, we will be using the ACL Pubcheck tool (https://github.com/acl-org/aclpubcheck). The PDFs of camera-ready papers must be run through this tool prior to their final submission, and we recommend its use also at submission time.</p>

<h2 id="optional-supplementary-materials-appendices-software-and-data">Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data</h2>

<p>Each EMNLP 2022 submission can be accompanied by an appendix, which will appear in the main paper’s PDF, after the bibliography. A submission may also be accompanied by one .tgz or .zip archive containing software, and one .tgz or .zip archive containing data. EMNLP 2022 encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. For example, anonymised related work (see above), preprocessing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into the appendix. However, the paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. If the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in the appendix. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.</p>
