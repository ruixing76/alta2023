During this meeting, we brainstormed together about how we can make our conferences more inclusive and diverse. Here we summarize the major points discussed. We hope that this feedback helps the ACL D&amp;I committee, as well as the ongoing and future conference D&amp;I teams to keep making progress towards the very important goal of increasing access to these conferences.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Money is one of the biggest challenges. The common thread in recent conferences, including ACL 2022, NAACL 2022, and EMNLP 2022, is that there is not enough money to support members of the community that need financial support. Some points regarding this:
    <ul>
      <li>There is a concern regarding how much the special D&amp;I sponsorship package is being advertised. Do sponsors know that there is this special package? It is listed on the brochure, but it’s at the very end. Perhaps instead of having a separate package for D&amp;I we should have a % of the sponsorship earmarked for D&amp;I with the option to allow sponsors to allocate more to that fund.</li>
      <li>Can we have a yearound mechanism to accept funds for D&amp;I initiatives? Often the fiscal cycles of the sponsors do not align with our conference timeline. We can enable a mechanism to donate to a general D&amp;I pot year round.</li>
      <li>The D&amp;I budget becomes thinner when we have to pay back to ACL for registration of participants receiving conference waivers. It is not clear why this is the current policy, but if this would change, this money could be reallocated differently.</li>
      <li>Another way to stretch the money is to have D&amp;I recipients be volunteers, currently this is optional, but perhaps this could be made a default. The idea being that by becoming volunteers, newcomers will have an easier experience networking and learning how to take full advantage of the conference.</li>
      <li>Maybe the ACL can consider having a paid staff to actively engage with sponsorship opportunities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can we facilitate booking tickets for subsidy recipients? For many, footing the airplane ticket, even if temporary, is complicated, so having someone at ACL that can handle their booking for them will make the whole experience less stressful.</li>
  <li>There is almost no support for attendees with hearing challenges. Can we have at least one interpreter assigned to main sessions and perhaps some of the posters/talks? Scaling is a concern here.</li>
  <li>Online fees are still very high. Can we have a more transparent mechanism to set the prices? Can we have a scaling registration price? Other conferences do a better job at this.</li>
  <li>Can we bring back the big brother/sister program where newcomers are paired with a more experienced attendee?</li>
  <li>Bring back student lunches, and include postdocs.</li>
  <li>The virtual component still needs improvement. We should not abandon the virtual aspect of the conference. In order to help ensure the smooth hand-over from one D&amp;I committee to the next, it would be useful to have the current committee (or one of its members) become an advisor member to the next one, so that their experience and knowledge is passed on. This would help the new D&amp;I committees improve on the practices already tested, learn from their mistakes, etc.</li>

<h2 id="author-and-audience">Author and Audience</h2>

<p>The primary author of this document is a cisgender gay Arab-American man. He has lived in the UAE with his cisgender gay European-American partner for almost a decade. They both have academic jobs, and love living in the UAE.</p>

<p>The author’s advice and observations are based on his experience of living in the UAE, and his awareness of issues faced by other members of the LGBTQ+ community there. The intended audience of this document are LGBTQ+ conference attendees of EMNLP 2022.</p>

<p>This document is not intended to provide official legal advice.</p>

<p><strong>Many thanks to all the community members (LGBTQ+ and allies) who helped with reviewing and editing different versions of this document.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-public-and-the-private">The Public and The Private</h2>

<p>Emirati culture values a separation between public and private lives in a way that’s different from some Western nations. In Abu Dhabi, <u>regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation</u>, public displays of affection are generally frowned upon, especially prolonged intimate actions.There is no dress code but general modesty for both men and women is the expected norm. <strong>Beyond that, privacy is highly respected: what one does in their own home is their business. In in-between public-private spaces, such as hotels, the expectation for all unmarried couples (gay or straight) is to have separate beds</strong>. These can be two double beds. But no one will check what happens in the room.</p>

<h2 id="diversity-and-tasamuh">Diversity and Tasamuh</h2>

<p>The UAE is very diverse in terms of the countries of origin of its residents – with close to 90% non-Emiratis and 30% non-Muslims. The diverse backgrounds have created a regional norm around different cultures coexisting. The UAE’s attitude about the diversity of its residents is that of “Mutual Tolerance,” the Arabic concept of تسامح tasāmuh, which comes from the root smh  associated with concepts like forgiveness, permission, tolerance, magnanimity, and the pattern ta-ā-u- of mutuality.  In other words — <strong>live and let live</strong>. The UAE even has a dedicated <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.tolerance.gov.ae/en/default.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1664870428955606&amp;usg=AOvVaw1QfS0UTuPT0S7zjBzCCB_G">Ministry of Tolerance</a>.</p>

<p>To date, this concept has not been explicitly expanded to include sexual orientation or gender identity. However, in practice, accepting cultural diversity indirectly includes accepting some sexual and gender diversity since mutual tolerance covers opinions held by people from different cultural backgrounds. Also, perhaps more subtly, the cultural diversity in the UAE leads to more tolerance of diversity of gender expression; <strong>what some in the West would consider gay or queer may be a straight or unmarked behavior in other cultures. This goes beyond gender being a social construct, to it being constructed differently in different cultures</strong>.</p>

<p>Examples abound in the UAE of behaviors that may be marked differently in different cultures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Men holding hands is not marked as gay among Arabs, but rather as indicator of close friendship.</li>
  <li>Men kissing men on the cheeks (typically 3-4 times alternating) is not marked at all and in some cases it is rude not to kiss back.</li>
  <li>Very subtle and specific behaviors that are caricatured gay stereotypes in the West like lifting the pinky when drinking from a cup is not marked in the Arab World at all. You will see men doing this; and it means nothing.</li>
  <li>Same-gender people living together as roommates is not marked as gay/lesbian. The default assumption is simply that they have families elsewhere and need to save money… or no explanation is needed.</li>
  <li>Emirati men sometimes greet each other with a so-called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Nai5VZR8s">nose-kiss</a>” that looks too intimate for non-Emiratis.</li>
  <li>While Emirati men typically wear white Kanduras (dresses), some Arab and also European men like to dress in a more colorful style than most American straight men do. The variability is not judged or marked in any way that connects it to gender/sexuality. Think of the Legally Blond song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY9PmBNb3PE&amp;t=85s">Gay or European</a>”. This ambiguity covers a wide range of androgynous hair and dress styles that are not marked.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In sum, many of the public expressions of gender that visitors may embody are not consistently marked across all cultures; and with a multicultural society like the UAE, the signal is simply lost in the “noise of multiculturalism”</strong>. So, for most cis/cis-passing folks, there is no need to stress about being perceived one way or another. Of course, the situation is more complex for transgender people. More on that below.</p>

<h2 id="laws-and-practices">Laws and Practices</h2>

<p>There are no federal LGBTQ+-specific laws in the UAE. However, some prohibitions intended to protect women can be interpreted as restricting gender expression.  For example, UAE Penal Code Article 412 part 2 states that “any male who disguises as a woman, or enters a place allocated for women only, or to which entry of men is forbidden,” the penalties can include a fine of no more than AED10,000 or imprisonment of one year or both” (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lovin.co/dubai/en/latest/cross-dressing-is-criminalised-once-again-in-the-uae&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1664870677664940&amp;usg=AOvVaw3WSjNEz0my6Zp9VzLrWpP8">More details here</a>). Several emirates, including Abu Dhabi and Dubai, have additional prohibitions on behaviors, but these laws are almost never invoked because of the country’s general respect of privacy for its residents. See <a href="http://internap.hrw.org/features/features/lgbt_laws/index-june15.html">Human Rights Watch</a> for more details. Of course, this situation is not different from many places around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy_laws_in_the_United_States#:~:text=Eleven%20states%27%20statutes%20purport%20to,Carolina%2C%20Oklahoma%20and%20South%20Carolina">world that still have archaic laws</a>.</p>

<p>Up to January of 2022, UAE law prohibited cohabitation of unmarried straight couples; this since has changed.  Homosexual couples never suffered this issue because they are seen as simply roommates.</p>

<h2 id="trans-and-non-binary-individuals">Trans and Non-binary Individuals</h2>

<p>Gender dysphoria is recognized as a medical condition in the UAE, and <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/health/new-uae-law-allows-gender-reassignment-surgery-1.218691">gender affirming surgery is legal in the UAE</a>. The main challenge for transgender individuals is legal paper work (passport, id) that is not updated from their birth sex to match their current gender expression. In such cases, the individual may be denied entry if they present themselves in a way that mismatches their paperwork upon entry to the country.</p>

<p>The UAE, like many other countries, uses visual inspection of documents as the primary means of identification of travelers. This is unlike countries such as the United States, where biometrics (e.g., your fingerprints) are used. Visitors should make sure that pictures on any of their travel documents match their current appearance; if not, the visitor might be subject to additional scrutiny when going through passport control. The worst of it will be wasted time at the airport, and denial of entry. Examples of famous cases where this happened include the case of transgender models <a href="https://vidooly.com/blog/gigi-gorgeous-dubai-airport-detained/">Gigi Gorgeous</a> and <a href="https://sea.mashable.com/life/19811/thai-trans-model-turned-away-at-dubai-airport-for-possessing-male-passport">Rachaya Noppakaroon</a>.</p>

<p>Some countries now issue non-binary gender classification (e.g. M/F/X). This is not an issue as UAE immigration follows international agreements between the UAE government and these countries’ governments to respect their documents. However, many countries still do not allow updating the sex on the passport.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately, for transgender individuals who do not have updated legal documents, our advice is to avoid the hassle and only participate virtually in the conference. This is grossly unfair of course. We hope these regulations will be changed in the future</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="online-sources-of-misinformation">Online Sources of Mis/Information</h2>

<p>There is a lot of misinformation online about the UAE and LGBTQ+ issues. Some of the Wikipedia and Wikitravel pages are filled with inaccurate information on this topic. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_Arab_Emirates">wikipedia page on LGBTQ rights in the UAE</a> claims that gay men are given the death penalty in the UAE; this is not true - the law is mistranslated from the Arabic (where it is specifically about rape). For some time, the <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/United_Arab_Emirates">wikitravel</a> page on the UAE claimed that there are “vigilante executions” against gay people in the UAE all the time with police complicity, which is outrageously false.</p>

<h2 id="safety-in-a-broader-sense">Safety in a Broader Sense</h2>

<p><strong>Abu Dhabi is a very safe city, with a very low level of crime</strong>. It compares very positively to other locations where other CL conferences were held this year as shown in the the following figure:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/lgbtq+-visitor-blog/safety-chart.jpg" alt="image" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, there are numerous international institutions that have branches in Abu Dhabi: <a href="https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/">New York University</a>, <a href="https://www.sorbonne.ae/">The Sorbonne University</a>, <a href="https://www.louvreabudhabi.ae/">The Louvre Museum</a>, and others, many of whom employ and host LGBTQ people. <a href="https://www.expo2020dubai.com/">Expo 2020</a> was a huge international event hosted in Dubai, with millions of visitors. All these people and organizations would not have chosen to be in the UAE if it was unsafe.</p>

<h2 id="changing-world">Changing World</h2>

<p>The Arab World is not a monolith; it is a vibrant continuously evolving place. It may be behind the West in terms of LGBTQ liberation. But there are ongoing conversations and efforts in the public sphere in the Arab World about this issue.  It just needs time. Not all countries will be on board and not at the same time.  The UAE has impressively broken many political and social taboos that no one thought could be challenged in the last ten years: from peace with Israel to allowing unmarried cohabitation and open restaurants during the month of fasting, Ramadan.</p>

<p>On the LGBTQ liberation front, here are some links of interest:</p>

<p>Conferences and other international events like EMNLP actively participate in this change - through a combination of expressed reservations (thanks to all those who tweeted their concerns!) as well as presenting role models of successful LGBTQ people to new communities (advanced thanks to all those who will join us in Abu Dhabi in person or virtually).</p>]]></content><author><name>Local Organization Committee</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="announcement" /><category term="publicity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog post provides some insights and advice for LGBTQ+ visitors by LGBTQ+ people living in Abu Dhabi.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Call for Diversity and Inclusion Subsidies</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/Call-for-Diversity-and-Inclusion-Subsidies/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Call for Diversity and Inclusion Subsidies" /><published>2022-09-30T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2022-09-30T00:00:00+10:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/Call-for-Diversity-and-Inclusion-Subsidies</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/Call-for-Diversity-and-Inclusion-Subsidies/"><![CDATA[<p>Applicants should fill out the application form at <a href="https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=vboLF_CikEytSw6PDwxCWemzwJvCZ35BqxNNwxlrCkZUM1VVSFVMTTY1Njg0M1ZTQUhJRTRCUVZMSi4u">Microsoft Office Form Link</a></p>

<h2 id="general-information">General Information</h2>
<p>EMNLP 2022 is providing D&amp;I funds for registration, caregiving, bandwidth, travel and VPN subsidies. We strongly encourage researchers from developing countries and marginalized communities to apply for subsidies to maximize their chances of receiving support by EMNLP. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis. Please apply as soon as possible so we can allocate you promptly before the funding runs out. Applications will close by October 21st at this <a href="https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=vboLF_CikEytSw6PDwxCWemzwJvCZ35BqxNNwxlrCkZUM1VVSFVMTTY1Njg0M1ZTQUhJRTRCUVZMSi4u">link</a>.</p>

<h2 id="registration-subsidies">Registration subsidies</h2>
<p>This is for getting a waiver for EMNLP registration. You can also request ACL membership if applicable. You will be asked to justify your application. For instance, you can say:</p>

<p>1) <em>“I have an accepted paper at the main conference. I would like to apply for a registration fee waiver because my fees are not funded by my organization/institution.”</em></p>

<p>2) <em>“I have an accepted paper at a EMNLP Workshop, I live in a developing country and I/my institution cannot afford the registration fees. ”</em></p>

<p>3) <em>“I have a paper accepted at the main conference/workshop/ and I am an active member of Latinx/Masakhane/North African in NLP/QueerinAI/WNLP.”</em></p>

<p>Note that if you are applying for a registration fee waiver, you <strong>SHOULD NOT register for the conference until you hear from us about your D&amp;I subsidy application.</strong> That way, you would not have to ask for a reimbursement, since you would not be charged in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="travel-and-accommodation-subsidies">Travel and accommodation subsidies</h2>
<p>We are also providing travel and accommodation subsidies. Priority will be given to authors, first-time attendees and folks from underrepresented communities.</p>

<p>If you would like to attend the in-person meeting please keep in mind that if your application for subsidy is accepted, <strong>only for the accommodations, we offer to pay before the conference. However, travel expenses are reimbursable after the conference dates. We will reimburse the plane ticket after the conference.</strong></p>

<p>The number of accepted applicants and the amount offered could vary depending on the number of applicants and the availability of funding. We encourage you to apply as early as possible so you have the best chance to get the subsidy before the D&amp;I funds run out.</p>

<h2 id="caregiving-and-accessibility-subsidies">Caregiving and accessibility subsidies</h2>
<p>We can reimburse caregiving expenses conference. You need to provide receipts for your out of pocket expenses. These can be babysitting, transportation costs, or other support required for yourself or your dependents, which would ease your participation. If you need any personal or technical assistance to access and navigate the conference due to a disability, we can reimburse you for the cost of it. We acknowledge that accessibility needs are highly individual to each participant, so please feel free to reach out to us with any issues you might face in this regard. When justifying your caregiving and accessibility subsidy application, you can say for example: “As a caregiver, I would like to apply for a caregiving subsidy of n USD to take care of my child when I will be presenting my work at the conference.”</p>

<h2 id="bandwidth-and-vpn-subsidies">Bandwidth and VPN subsidies</h2>
<p>We can reimburse bandwidth or VPN purchases that you need for the conference. You need to provide receipts for your purchases. Bandwidth subsidies would be for high-speed internet access costs for the <strong>duration of the conference only</strong>. VPN generally does not cost more than 10 USD per month and could be applied towards participation if you need anonymity to participate completely. A justification example can be:</p>

<p>1) <em>“I am from a remote village where I depend on my cellular internet. I would need n USD to increase my quote as my current plan is not suitable for video conferencing (add a link to the tariff of your internet subscriber if possible).”</em></p>

<p>2) <em>“As a queer person, I worry about my safety and privacy and I would like to apply for a VPN subsidy of n USD to avoid surveillance (link to the service provider if possible).”</em></p>

<h2 id="selection-criteria">Selection Criteria</h2>
<p>Applicants will be evaluated based on the material they submit in their application packages. Preference will be given to underrepresented applicants who are presenting a paper at the main conference, the Student Research Workshop, or any of the workshops associated with EMNLP, or those whose participation at the conference will bring the largest impact, and who do not have other means of support.</p>

<h2 id="application-deadline">Application deadline</h2>
<p>Applications will be considered on a rolling basis. Please apply as soon as possible so we can allocate you promptly before the funding runs out.</p>

<p>No applications will be considered after October 21st.</p>

<h2 id="notification-of-acceptance">Notification of acceptance</h2>
<p>1 week before the early registration deadline. (Please visit https://2022.emnlp.org/ for more details.)</p>

<p>We aim to send all notifications by the deadline above. However, we will start processing the applications as they come and you may be contacted earlier.</p>

<p>A review form will often ask you two things: is the paper sound, and is the paper impactful? These are phrased as separate questions. I argue that there are at least four ways for a paper to have impact, and that the type of impact changes how you should judge soundness.</p>

<p>In addition to the authors, the main audience for a review is the area chair. The area chair’s job is to decide which papers of about 15-20 they would like to advocate for to the committee that actually makes decisions. How can you, as a reviewer, make this process faster and more efficient? You need to know how an area chair will use your review to make a case for a paper.</p>

<p>Quick guide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is this something people want to know?</li>
  <li>Will the system be used?</li>
  <li>Will the paper change other people’s direction?</li>
  <li>Will this be the paper people talk about in the hall?</li>
</ul>

<p>What a lot of newer reviewers don’t realize is that there are multiple types of “acceptable” papers: papers that an area chair is willing to recommend, and recommend in a way that is compelling to the senior committee. You assume that all papers are ranked on the same quality scale, and the best ones get in. I noticed a long time ago that students applying to college think this way too: you just have to be the perfect student, and you’ll get in. But when you listen to admissions officers, they don’t talk about admitting students individually, they talk about “putting together a class”. It’s the same with a conference. You don’t want to accept 300 variations of the same paper, even if it’s done really well.</p>

<p>Conferences want a variety of topics, but they also want a variety of impacts. To help the area chair write a meta review, you need to make it clear what type of impact the paper is likely to have, and evaluate it in a way that is appropriate. Here are some archetypes of papers that have impact in different ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Cliffhanger. Given what has worked in the past, there’s an obvious next step. So what’s the answer? Publishing the result will put everyone else one step ahead. This is the most common type of paper that we tend to accept. It’s also the least likely to have lasting impact, but it has real impact right now. Since a lot of people might see the same opportunity, and it’s not that different from what we already know how to do, the bar is high in terms of execution. Evaluations should be complete, details should be spelled out. We all know it’s best to write the “first” paper or the “last” paper on a subject, but someone has to write the papers in the middle. What the area chair wants to know is, is this paper going to advance the field to the next step? Is this something people want to know?</li>
  <li>The Screwdriver. It may be more or less glamorous, but it’s useful, and every reader will at least consider using it and citing it. The biggest citation monsters tend to be Screwdrivers. Think ADAM or AdaGrad, or an evaluation benchmark like SQUAD. Here the reproducibility and robustness have to be even stronger than a Cliffhanger. If the point is that it be useful, it has to be usable. What the area chair wants to know is, is this something that will make future work better? You can have the strongest evaluation in the world, but if it’s not solving a problem that people face in a way that they can access and would choose over alternatives, it’s not going to have impact.</li>
  <li>The Stone in the Pond. You heaved a stone into a pond. Splash! Then watch the ripples go out, and bounce back. The impact of this paper is bigger than the stone itself. The critical question here is not whether every detail is fully developed, but whether the paper has the potential to trigger a lot of other work as a result. One thing I see almost every time I area-chair is a Pond Stone paper being evaluated as a Cliffhanger or a Screwdriver. These papers are often radically new directions where we don’t necessarily have a lot of comparisons and we don’t necessarily know exactly how to evaluate them. But they’re still valuable in that they push people to consider new directions. The other pathology I see with this type of paper is reviewers who expect the Stone to include all of its ripples. If a paper initiates a radically new approach, it’s unlikely that it will answer every question in 9 pages, so if you don’t feel that the work is complete, maybe that’s the point. The value of a Stone in the Pond is the - Cliffhangers that it inspires, not just what it has in itself. The area chair wants to know whether this paper will change what readers do next.</li>
  <li>The Salt. By weight, a very small part of any meal is salt, but leave it out and you’ll notice that everything tastes flat. In the same way, every conference needs some papers that are profound, or evoke a sense of awe, or are just fun. These are the papers that fill a room, that people circle on their conference schedules, that people tell their family about when they ask “so what is it you do again?”. Like the Stone in the Pond, these papers are not always methodologically innovative and may not have bulletproof evaluation. But honestly, how many papers about the latest neural network trick or improvement on a standard evaluation can you stand before you just want to go see something about generating haikus? These are the papers that give a conference texture and memorability. The question the area chair wants to know is not will people use it, or will people extend it, but will people talk about it in the hall?</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you can see the varieties of impact, it becomes more clear what types of critiques are most useful in determining if the paper under review actually matches one of these. I’m not saying that all submissions are one of these – plenty of papers don’t succeed in matching any of them. It’s that all submissions that I want to see accepted should most likely fit one or more.</p>]]></content><author><name>Website Chairs</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="announcement" /><category term="publicity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The four categories of acceptable papers]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Information Sessions and Promotional Video for EMNLP 2022</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/Information-Sessions-and-Promotional-Video-for-EMNLP-2022/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Information Sessions and Promotional Video for EMNLP 2022" /><published>2022-07-29T00:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2022-07-29T00:00:00+10:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/Information-Sessions-and-Promotional-Video-for-EMNLP-2022</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/Information-Sessions-and-Promotional-Video-for-EMNLP-2022/"><![CDATA[<p>As part of promoting EMNLP 2022 in Abu Dhabi, the local organizing committee chair, Nizar Habash, held information sessions in three major conferences this year: ACL 2022, LREC 2022, and NAACL 2022.
