<h3 id="international-flights">International Flights</h3>

<p>Over 88 airlines operate direct flights into the UAE international airports, covering more than 200 cities around the world.</p>

<p>The country’s two major carriers, <a href="https://www.etihad.com/en-ae/">Etihad Airways</a> and <a href="https://www.emirates.com/english/">Emirates Airline</a> are the fastest growing in the world and provide non-stop service to all continents in the world with the exception of Antarctica. The UAE also boasts three low-cost carriers: <a href="https://wizzair.com/en-gb">Wizz Air</a>, <a href="https://www.flydubai.com/en/">Fly Dubai</a> and <a href="https://www.airarabia.com/en">Air Arabia</a>, the three combined provide nonstop services to over 145 destinations.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.abudhabiairport.ae/en">Abu Dhabi International Airport</a> is one of only a handful of airports outside North America that offer the <a href="https://www.abudhabiairport.ae/en/services-and-facilities/us-pre-clearance-facility">US Customs and Border Protection Pre-clearance facility</a>. Having cleared Customs and Border Protection, guests can check through their baggage to their final destination in the US. When they arrive, they will be treated as domestic passengers, meaning they will save time connecting to other flights or on to their final destination.</p>

<!-- **Public Holidays**

Islamic holidays are based on the Hijri calendar which is controlled by the sighting of the moon. As a result the dates of holidays are often confirmed less than 24 hours in advance. Some of these are Eid Al Fitr (three days), Eid Al Adha (four days) and Al Hejra (one day). Fixed dates on the calendar are New Year’s Day (Jan 1) and UAE National Day (Dec 2). -->

<p><strong>Can I drink alcohol in the UAE?</strong></p>

<p>The legal drinking age in the UAE is 21, except in the Emirate of Sharjah, where alcohol consumption is illegal. Sharjah is situated north of Dubai, about 1 hour and 45 minutes from Abu Dhabi by car. Being intoxicated in public is not permitted. Abu Dhabi has a zero-tolerance policy, and there are severe fines and penalties for those caught driving while under the influence.</p>

<!--  Guidebooks and conversations with colleagues offer many suggestions for polite and appropriate behavior in Abu Dhabi. For example, learn a selection of Arabic phrases and use them when greeting new people.

When you are seated, make sure the sole of your foot is not pointing directly at anyone, as this would be insulting. Use your right hand to offer an item to another person or to receive items. For example, offer your business card with your right hand; you can receive one with both hands. The business week is Monday through Friday. -->

<!-- Add few nice Arabic phrases here....

| English | Pronunciation |  عربي |
|------|-------|-------|
| Hello | as-salamu alaykum | السلام عليكم|
|      |  marhaba | مرحبا|

**What advice can you give LGBTQI+ travellers in the UAE?**

There are no federal LGBTQI-specific laws in the UAE except for some prohibitions
on gender expression. Several emirates, including Abu Dhabi and Dubai, have additional prohibitions. See [Human Rights Watch](http://internap.hrw.org/features/features/lgbt_laws/index-june15.html) for more details.
Discretion is generally advisable.  -->
