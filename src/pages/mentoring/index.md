### What is mentoring?
Mentoring is generally considered to be a voluntary relationship that gives people the
opportunity to share their skills, knowledge and experiences, both personal and professional.

### Three key benefits for the mentor
* Improve interpersonal skills in counselling, listening, modelling, and leading.
* Access new perspectives, information, and knowledge.
* Enhance professional relationships and networks.

### Three key benefits for the mentee
* Receive valuable feedback from an experienced and subject-matter expert.
* Have opportunities to develop networks with experienced and positive role models. 
* Have a supportive environment in which successes and failures can be evaluated in a non-confrontational manner and new ideas can be tested.

### How does it work?
To initiate a mentoring session, a mentee should proactively organise a meeting with an ALTA mentor in advance during or after the ALTA workshop. 

Step 1: Choose a mentor from the ALTA mentor list.

Step 2: Contact him/her via an email or Slack channel of the workshop. 

Step 3: Organise a mentoring session either virtually (e.g., Zoom, Kumospace or Slack) or in person.

### Boundaries of the mentor relationship
Professional and ethical behaviour is expected at all times in a mentor relationship. A mentor and a mentee should treat the relationship with respect and maintain privacy/confidentiality of conversations. It is important that the mentee makes his/her own decisions and is responsible for his/her own actions.
